I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/). I work with my advisor [Dr. Pratap Tokekar](http://tokekar.github.io/) in the [Robotic Algorithms & Autonomous Systems (RAAS) Lab](http://raaslab.org/).

Research Interests
======
My research specialization is in robotics and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I solve path planning, perception, and deep learning problems for robotics applications. This includes deploying solutions in simulation environments such as Gazebo and AirSim as well as real-world applications utilizing DJI's frameworks.

Education and Work Experience
======
I am working on my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I obtained my M.S. in Computer Engineering in 2017 and my B.S. in Computer Engineering in 2014 from [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). I have also interned with [NASA JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) during my Ph.D. as well as multiple internships with the Federal Goverment during my B.S. and M.S.
